<cite>Slay the Princess</cite> is a breathtaking visual novel that explores obedience, rebellion, heartbreak, love, and
everything in between. Emotional voice acting, unreliable narrators, and multiple player "personalities" set this game
apart.

Chilling words form the bare-bones opening scene of
[<cite>Slay the Princess</cite>](https://www.slaytheprincess.com/){: target="_blank"}. You're given the opportunity to
ask a few clarifying questions, but *The Narrator* provides little insight. This lack of clarity makes the grim mission
somehow clearer: we have one job to do. If we're to take *The Narrator* at his word, the stakes are high, and we must
grit our teeth and continue on. Narrators are to be trusted... aren't they? They are oracles of omniscient fact, what he
says must be true.

> We're not going to go through with this, right? She's a princess. We're supposed to save princesses, not slay them.
> <cite>Voice of the Hero</cite>

A second voice, suggestively named *Voice of the Hero*, picks up a dialog with *The Narrator*. Is this who *we* are? The
game does not make it clear, though there's clearly no one else present. I chose to believe that this voice is
essentially a voice of our subconscious; <span class="praise" title="Praise">a way for the game to put words in the
player's mouth without stepping on toes</span>. Soon more voices than just the *Voice of the Hero* will chime in, but
I'm getting ahead of myself.

If we are *The Hero*, we make a good point... <big>Heroes don't slay princesses, they save them.</big>

> A word of warning before you continue. She will lie, she will cheat, and she will do everything in her power to stop
> you from slaying her. Don't believe a word she says.
> <cite>The Narrator</cite>

At this point I'm getting a bit nervous -- who's to say that *The Princess* really is evil? Or perhaps she's not *evil*,
but truly innocent, a pawn in someone else's scheme to end the world, a victim in some vile plot to control me, the
player... the Hero? We are faced with only two sources of information from which to try and separate fact from fiction:
*The Narrator*, whose motives are unknown; and the as of yet unmet *Princess*, who may not have any more context than we
do. The only real choice is to continue on and try to make the choice for ourselves.

Continuing into the cabin we're presented with another choice: there is a dagger on the table, ahead of the stairs
leading to *The Princess*. Taking the dagger feels like a step in the direction of *The Narrator*'s goals -- but leaving
it may prove unwise as well. Hovering the mouse cursor over the dagger, I notice something I hadn't before: <span
class="praise" title="Praise">the cursor is a dark, clawed hand, almost reminiscent of a bird's claw. What sort of hero
are we? Are we in fact some monster, typecast into a role as a murderer of princesses? Here again the game pushes subtle
burden onto us</span>. Or am I falling into a trap built of my own prejudices, that a non-human in a fantasy story must
be evil?

Entering the basement reveals a dark wooden staircase, as *The Narrator* proceeds to wax long about the conditions of
this environment, claiming that <q>slaying her is probably doing her a favor</q>; *The Narrator* is ever so subtly
baiting me towards the path of slaying *The Princess*. My continuing instinct is to resist this coercion.

> Who's there?
> <cite>The Princess</cite>

Her voice is confident, yet guarded. <span class="praise" title="Praise">The voice acting is tremendously well done, and
I highly recommend listening through some quality headphones to pick up the subtlest of emotions measured carefully into
each and every line</span>. As we continue down the stairs we see her for the first time. A smallish woman, slight of
frame and with long, straight hear, wearing a simple yet refined dress and a tiara. She's shackled by one wrist to the
wall as she sits on the floor beneath a barred window. The *Voice of the Hero* chimes in to describe her as "coldly
beautiful". As she continues to speak, her voice is confident and unafraid.

> And there you are. Are you here to kill me or something?
> <cite>The Princess</cite>

I'd lie if I said I wasn't taken aback by this. She's *expecting us*, and she's *not afraid*. Not even nervous; in fact
she seems almost... nonchalant? This scenario is perhaps even more complex than I had anticipated. And then she *baits
you into coming closer...*

<cite>Slay the Princess</cite> is a tremendously beautiful game. Regardless of how the first chapter ends, the game
continues. If we die, we reappear at the beginning, though with a new chapter title. *The Narrator* seems to not know --
or at least, not acknowledge -- that the game has reset. The game does save you some time by removing or disabling
narrative choices that you've made before, which was appreciated. As we continue to the princess a second time, new
voices appear in congress with *The Narrator* and the *Voice of the Hero*; they seem to represent further aspects of our
subconscious, amplified and expressed through the choices we made in the previous chapter. As for *The Princess*, we can
see that she's *changed* as well -- how so depends on your choices in the first chapter, but she's become a *more*
intense version of herself towards whatever emotion you evoked from her before, and it's even altered her physical
appearance and that of the cabin and dungeon.

In fact, as we continue it becomes apparent that the goal of the game is to "collect" as many different aspects of her
personality together as we can, often greatly at our own expense. <span class="praise" title="Praise">*The Princess* is
a complex and nuanced character, and evoking these different emotions from her was a beautiful exploration of the human
psyche</span>. You continue this pattern for some time, and while I won't fully spoil the ending of the game in this
editorial, I will say that the ending**s** -- for there are more than one -- are very complex and nuanced, and I still
don't fully understand everything that this game was trying to say.

<big>But I do know that it was beautiful.</big>

## Critical Analysis

*Caution: major spoilers ahead.*{: style="text-align:center;" .slight}

### Plot

The plot of <cite>Slay the Princess</cite> seems simple enough at first: you are given a task and expected to complete
it. But as the game continues it becomes apparent that things are not as simple as they seem. As each series of chapters
draws to a close, some aspect of *The Princess*'s personality is amplified, distilled almost, and then snatched away by
a multitude of hands emerging from the ether. The player is then dropped into an endless void in which we find *The
Shifting Mound*, an almost gaia like entity that seems to be the amalgamation of all the versions of *The Princess*.
It's lost and naive, but it does know that it needs to find more versions of *The Princess*, and that we can find them
for it.

So we continue this pattern for a while, and slowly we come to understand that we are in some way like *The Shifting
Mound*, timeless and detached from these realities, a yin to her yang, almost. Where we came from or how we got into
this situation is still unclear, but as there isn't much else to do we continue collecting princesses. Eventually we
find that *The Narrator* is responsible for our existence, having summoned us into being in order to cleanse death from
the world. We were a mighty god-like being, it seems, and *The Narrator* split us into two parts: *The Shifting Mound*
(*The Princess*), and *The Long Quiet* (us, the player). The choice of a princess and a hero was chosen by our
subconscious and wasn't anticipated by *The Narrator*, but we had to be *something*. *The Narrator*'s goal was
ultimately for us to destroy (slay) *The Shifting Mound* (the princess) and thus cut out the part of the deity we once
were that is responsible for death's existence in the world we preside over.

There are many many different incarnations of *The Princess* that we can collect, and several endings to the game, all
of which seem worthwhile to find. In fact, the game unlocks a "gallery" after the first playthrough showing you which
branching narrative paths you've taken, and which you've yet to discover through subsequent playthroughs. In the end, it
seems *The Narrator* was more or less forthcoming at the beginning: his intention was for us to Slay the Princess, and
if we failed, the world would end.

### Gameplay

<cite>Slay the Princess</cite> features simple gameplay comprised of artwork of the current scene with a subtle parallax
effect, subtitles, and, when relevant, narrative choices for the player to take. The entire setup is extremely simple
yet effective for deep storytelling such as this.

### Graphics & Art

The artwork of <cite>Slay the Princess</cite> may be comprised of simple pen drawings, but the care put in to facial
expressions and environmental detail is stunning; truly the result of passionate effort on the part of the artists.
